# 1.OTP Verification using Python

OTP Verification is the process of verifying a user by sending a unique password so that the user can be verified before completing a registration or payment process. Most of the time, we get an OTP when we make an online payment, or when we forget our password, or when creating an account on any online platform. Thus, the sole purpose of an OTP is to verify the identity of a user by sending a unique password.

We can easily create an application for the task of OTP verification using Python by following the steps mentioned below:

1.First, create a 6-digit random number

2.Then store the number in a variable

3.Then we need to write a program to send emails

4.When sending email, we need to use OTP as a message

5.Finally, we need to request two user inputs; first for the user’s email and then for the OTP that the user has received.

So this is the complete process of creating an OTP verification application using Python. In the section below, I will take you through how to implement these steps using Python for the task of OTP verification.

# 2.TIC TAC TOE GAME USING PYTHON

In this game a player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, the usual games use “X” and “O”. If the first player chooses “X”, then the second player must play with “O” and vice versa.

A player marks one of the 3×3 squares with his symbol (perhaps “X” or “O”) and he aims to create a straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally with two intensions:

1.Create a straight line before your opponent to win the game.

2.Prevent his opponent from creating a straight line first.

If no one can logically create a straight line with its symbol, the game ends in a tie. So there are only three possible outcomes: one player wins, his opponent (human or computer) wins, or there is a tie.
